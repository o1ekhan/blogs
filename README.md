# Simple Blogging Platform API

This project is a simple CRUD API for a blogging platform, developed using Node.js and MongoDB. It allows for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting blog posts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- MongoDB

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the MongoDB service on your machine.

5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following line (update the value with your MongoDB connection string):

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/blogDB
```

6. Start the server:

```bash
node server.js
```

The server will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

The API supports the following endpoints:

### POST /blogs

- Description: Create a new blog post.
- Request body should include:
  - `title` (String)
  - `body` (String)
  - `author` (String)

### GET /blogs

- Description: Retrieve all blog posts.

### GET /blogs/:id

- Description: Retrieve a single blog post by ID.
- URL parameter: `id` - The ID of the blog post.

### PUT /blogs/:id

- Description: Update a blog post by ID.
- URL parameter: `id` - The ID of the blog post to update.
- Request body should include:
  - `title` (String)
  - `body` (String)
  - `author` (String)

### DELETE /blogs/:id

- Description: Delete a blog post by ID.
- URL parameter: `id` - The ID of the blog post to delete.

## Data Validation

The API includes data validation to ensure that all blog post submissions contain both a `title` and a `body`.

## Error Handling

The API includes error handling to return appropriate responses and HTTP status codes for database errors and bad requests.

## Testing

You can test the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or write automated tests to ensure all endpoints work as expected.

## Optional: Simple Interface

A basic front-end interface is provided to interact with the CRUD API. It allows for the creation and viewing of blog posts.

To access the interface, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` after starting the server.

## Notes

- The API uses native MongoDB methods for database operations.
- Each blog post includes a title, body, author, and automatically generated timestamps.
